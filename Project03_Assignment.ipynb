Use comments in your code to document your solution. If you need to write comments to the grader, add a markdown cell immediately above your code solution and add your comments there. Be sure to read and follow all the requirements and the Notebook Instructions at the bottom of this notebook. Your grade may depend on it!"

    ">  My wife is responsible for scheduling caregivers for her 93 year-old mother. Currently she writes out the schedule on a monthly calendar and photocopies it for everyone. I want all of you to help me write a program to help her with scheduling. While this is a specific application, this program will be broadly useful and adaptable to any scheduling needs for small businesses, clubs, and more."

    "#### Requirements\n",
    ">  Care is required 12 hours per day, 7 days a week. There are two shifts each day: 7:00 AM - 1:00 PM, and 1:00 PM to 7:00 PM. There are a total of 8 caregivers. Some are family members and some are paid. Each caregiver has their own availability for shifts that is generally the same from month to month, but there are exceptions for work, vacations, and other responsibilities. Your program should do the following:\n",
    "> 1. Manage caregivers and their schedules. Attributes include: name, phone, email, pay rate, and hours.\n",
    "> 2. Each caregiver should have their own availability schedule where they can indicate their availability for each shift. Availability categories are 'preferred', 'available' (default), and 'unavailable'.\n",
    "> 3. Create a care schedule that covers AM and PM shifts and displays caregiver names on a calendar (see example). The schedule should accomodate caregivers' individual schedules and availability preferences. The python calendar module provides options for creating HTML calendars. Sample code for the HTML calendar is in the project folder.\n",
    "> 4. Paid caregivers are paid weekly at $20/hr. Your program should calculate weekly pay based on assigned hours. Provide a separate pay report that lists weekly (gross: hours x rate) amounts to each caregiver, along with weekly and monthly totals. The report can be a text document, or presented in GUI or HTML format. "
